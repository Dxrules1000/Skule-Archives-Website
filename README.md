# Skule-Archives-Websites

This is the github for the Skule Archives website. The only contents of this git should be the
structure of the website as opposed to any meaningful data, that would be a bad idea. Work will
probably start in late Decemeber, I'm thinking the 20th off the top of my head, and some reference
images might be uploaded in the mean time. Also I need to figure out how to work with git.
